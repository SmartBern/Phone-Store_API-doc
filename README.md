This is the API documentation for a full-stack web project I developed, which I call Phone Store.

Phone Store is a web application that enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a phone (or product) store.

This API documentation details several endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that facilitate CRUD operations on the store.

Phone Store API documentation is OpenAPI-compliant and fully testable in Swagger UI.
